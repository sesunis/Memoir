Memoir
======

My idea for an app would be universal for both the iphone and ipad.  My idea is a virtual scrapbook, the title could be memoir or something along those lines,  an app that can be downloaded for free but offers purchased services. If services were not purchased after a certain amount of time, the input would be deleted. Photo Crops and icon packages could also be included. The app would virtually keep track of important things like sleeping patterns, bowel movements and feeding habits.  The app would record a calendar of the recorded firsts such as sleeping through the night for the first time, first smiles etc. The app revenue would stem from virtual baby book purchases that could be sent to any print store of choice.  Different packages could be purchased such as the first three months, the first 6 months etc.  the app would have the ability to upload photos from device into the app. the app would include reminders for doctor visits and allow input for info and progress since last check up.  The  scrapbook app would also have a setting for vacations to record every memory as well as a youngsters seasonal sport team, the template possibility is virtually endless  The target audience would be towards anyone owning an idevice and not singled to any direct audience allowing templates for babies, children, teens, family, grandparents, etc
