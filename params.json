{"name":"Memoir","tagline":"My idea for an app would be universal for both the iphone and ipad.  My idea is a virtual scrapbook, the title could be memoir or something along those lines,  an app that can be downloaded for free but offers purchased services. If services were not purchased after a certain amount of time, the input would be deleted. Photo Crops and icon packages could also be included. The app would virtually keep track of important things like sleeping patterns, bowel movements and feeding habits.  The app would record a calendar of the recorded firsts such as sleeping through the night for the first time, first smiles etc. The app revenue would stem from virtual baby book purchases that could be sent to any print store of choice.  Different packages could be purchased such as the first three months, the first 6 months etc.  the app would have the ability to upload photos from device into the app. the app would include reminders for doctor visits and allow input for info and progress since last check up.  The  scrapbook app would also have a setting for vacations to record every memory as well as a youngsters seasonal sport team, the template possibility is virtually endless  The target audience would be towards anyone owning an idevice and not singled to any direct audience allowing templates for babies, children, teens, family, grandparents, etc","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
